# Fully featured Hive CE

You can use it as a 'sandbox' to test its capabilities and features.

If you'd like to use full standalone version, you can download it [here](https://hexway.io/downloads/).

## Requirements

### Minimal hardware requirements

| OS    | CPU      | RAM                                    |
|-------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Linux | 2 core   | 4 GiB                                  |
| MacOS | 2 core   | 4 GiB for Docker Desktop, 8GiB overall |

### Software requirements

**OS**: Linux x86, MacOS x86

#### Prerequisites
* for Linux - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + [docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) (or [docker-compose standalone](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/));
* for MacOS - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)


## First launch

1. Open the terminal;
2. Execute the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:hexway/pentest-automation-tool.git

cd ./pentest-automation-tool

./hive-ctl start
```

3. The detached launch process will begin. 

After it is completed, the root password is shown, and you can start using the platform.

**NOTE**: 
* *If you didn't save or forgot the default root password, you can check it by running the following command:*
    
    ```           
    ./hive-ctl get-config-value b.root.password
    ```        

* *If the command `./hive-ctl start` resulted in timeout, you can run `./hive-ctl run` to be able to see container's standard output, and error streams*

## How to use

* The platform will be accessible at http://0.0.0.0 (port 80 is used by default).
* If you'd like to use ssl or change the default port, you can follow our Help Center articles:
    * https://help.hexway.io/hive/b_port_settings.md
    * https://help.hexway.io/hive/b_ssl_configs.md

**NOTE**: *While running the commands, you will need to replace `/opt/hw-bw/` to `./pentest-automation-tool/`, e.g. `/pentest-automation-tool/bin/reconfig`*


* After first launch you can use `./hive-ctl run` to start the application in foreground mode.

**NOTE**:*The application is not installed as a separate service and doesn't have the "AutoStart" property - if the computer/server is rebooted, you will need to launch the application manually*

* To see the full list of available commands, run `./hive-ctl help`.


## Deletion

To remove the application from the computer:
1. Stop the process:
   * `./hive-ctl stop` - if it was running detached, 
   * `ctrl+c` - if it was running interactively.
   
2. Remove all the data from the directory `pentest-automation-tool`.

All data collected during the testing is stored in the same directory that contains the application files.
After you remove the application directory, all collected information will be deleted as well.
