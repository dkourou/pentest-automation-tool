This is the default directory for SSL host's private key and full certificates chain to make https work.
Alternatively you may change the directory with the option `b.ssl.dir` in the `../config/user.ini` file.

Please, place the following files into the directory:
* `cert.pem`: ssl certificates chain for Hive
* `key.pem`: server private key

Please note that you need to set the correct access rights:
* the directory: at least read+execute for other users (e.g. 755).
* `*.pem` files: at least read for other users (e.g. 644).

Example:
```
chmod 755 .
chmod 644 *.pem
```
